WP Target Crop is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows front-end users to easily set and adjust focal points on images, ensuring that key areas of your images are always in focus, regardless of how they are displayed. Unlike traditional cropping tools, this plugin integrates seamlessly with WordPressâ€™s built-in image functions, making it the perfect solution for websites that need precise control over how images appear across different screen sizes and layouts.
